        <strong>a) Applicable Law and Jurisdiction:</strong> These Terms of

        LLC, unless otherwise indicated on such other agreement, will be
        governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of

        Service is adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
        unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated
        to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Service will

        <strong>c) Waiver:</strong> The failure of MESH Studios LLC to exercise

        Neither Party has any right or authority to incur, assume or create, in
        writing or otherwise, any warranty, liability or other obligation of any
        kind, express or implied, in the name of or on behalf of the other
